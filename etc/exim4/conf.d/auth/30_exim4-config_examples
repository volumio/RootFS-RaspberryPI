#################################

# The examples below are for server side authentication, when the
# local exim is SMTP server and clients authenticate to the local exim.

# They allow two styles of plain-text authentication against an
# CONFDIR/passwd file whose syntax is described in exim4_passwd(5).

# Hosts that are allowed to use AUTH are defined by the
# auth_advertise_hosts option in the main configuration. The default is
# "*", which allows authentication to all hosts over all kinds of
# connections if there is at least one authenticator defined here.
# Authenticators which rely on unencrypted clear text passwords don't
# advertise on unencrypted connections by default. Thus, it might be
# wise to set up TLS to allow encrypted connections. If TLS cannot be
# used for some reason, you can set AUTH_SERVER_ALLOW_NOTLS_PASSWORDS to
# advertise unencrypted clear text password based authenticators on all
# connections. As this is severely reducing security, using TLS is
# preferred over allowing clear text password based authenticators on
# unencrypted connections.

# PLAIN authentication has no server prompts. The client sends its
# credentials in one lump, containing an authorization ID (which we do not
# use), an authentication ID, and a password. The latter two appear as
# $auth2 and $auth3 in the configuration and should be checked against a
# valid username and password. In a real configuration you would typically
# use $auth2 as a lookup key, and compare $auth3 against the result of the
# lookup, perhaps using the crypteq{}{} condition.

# plain_server:
#   driver = plaintext
#   public_name = PLAIN
#   server_condition = "${if crypteq{$auth3}{${extract{1}{:}{${lookup{$auth2}lsearch{CONFDIR/passwd}{$value}{*:*}}}}}{1}{0}}"
#   server_set_id = $auth2
#   server_prompts = :
#   .ifndef AUTH_SERVER_ALLOW_NOTLS_PASSWORDS
#   server_advertise_condition = ${if eq{$tls_cipher}{}{}{*}}
#   .endif

# LOGIN authentication has traditional prompts and responses. There is no
# authorization ID in this mechanism, so unlike PLAIN the username and
# password are $auth1 and $auth2. Apart from that you can use the same
# server_condition setting for both authenticators.

# login_server:
#   driver = plaintext
#   public_name = LOGIN
#   server_prompts = "Username:: : Password::"
#   server_condition = "${if crypteq{$auth2}{${extract{1}{:}{${lookup{$auth1}lsearch{CONFDIR/passwd}{$value}{*:*}}}}}{1}{0}}"
#   server_set_id = $auth1
#   .ifndef AUTH_SERVER_ALLOW_NOTLS_PASSWORDS
#   server_advertise_condition = ${if eq{$tls_cipher}{}{}{*}}
#   .endif
#
# cram_md5_server:
#   driver = cram_md5
#   public_name = CRAM-MD5
#   server_secret = ${extract{2}{:}{${lookup{$auth1}lsearch{CONFDIR/passwd}{$value}fail}}}
#   server_set_id = $auth1

# Here is an example of CRAM-MD5 authentication against PostgreSQL:
#
# psqldb_auth_server:
#   driver = cram_md5
#   public_name = CRAM-MD5
#   server_secret = ${lookup pgsql{SELECT pw FROM users WHERE username = '${quote_pgsql:$auth1}'}{$value}fail}
#   server_set_id = $auth1

# plain_saslauthd_server:
#   driver = plaintext
#   public_name = PLAIN

# This one is a bad hack to support the broken version 4.xx of
# Microsoft Outlook Express which violates the RFCs by demanding
# "250-AUTH=" instead of "250-AUTH ".
# If your list of offered authenticators is other than PLAIN and LOGIN,
# you need to adapt the public_name line manually.
# It has to be the last authenticator to work and has not been tested
# well. Use at your own risk.
# See the thread entry point from
# http://www.exim.org/mail-archives/exim-users/Week-of-Mon-20050214/msg00213.html
# for the related discussion on the exim-users mailing list.
# Thanks to Fred Viles for this great work.
